								<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hands-on activities performed in 
									prelim period, I learned to create virtual machines and to set up a virtual network
									and to test the connectivity of virtual machines. In Hands-on Activity 2 I learned
									and understand to configure remote and local machines to connect via SSH using a KEY instead
									of using the password. In addition, I learned to verify connectivity to remote servers, to set up a 
									Git repository using local and remote repositories and to configure and run ad hoc commands from
									local machines to remote servers. In Hands-on Activity 3 I learned to download and install CentOS,
									to install SSH server on CentOS or RHEL-8 and to configure remote SSH connection from remote computer
									to CentOS or RHEL-8. In Hands-on Activity 4 I learned to run elevated ad hoc commands that would install, update,
									 and upgrade packages in the remote machines. In addition, I learned to create playbooks that record and 
									 execute ansible's configuration, deployment and orchestration functions. Lastly, In Hands-on Activity 5
									  I learned to consolidate playbooks plays, to apply when command in playbook for different OS distributions
									  and apply refactoring techniques in cleaning up the playbook codes which is important to speed up the execution
									  of plays in the playbook code.
								</p>

																
								<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hands-on activities performed in midterm period, I initially learned
									to target specific nodes and manage services by individualizing hosts, applying tags in 
									selecting plays to run and managing services from remote servers using playbooks in Hands-on Activity 6. In Hands-on Activity 
									7 I learned to implement the concept of managing files by copying a file from a local workstation to the remote server, to customize
									default website by creating html that contains basic html syntax, to copy a file while setting the permissions, and realized the importance
									of managing files. In addition, I learned to consolidate plays by implementing of roles in the playbook which would also help an administrator to
									easier locate errors and share or reuse a specific task by using roles. In Hands-on Activity 8 I learned to install Nagios using playbook
									while implementing roles and I learned about the availability monitoring tools and its benefits in managing servers and their benefits for users 
									that utilize availability monitoring tools. In Hands-on Activity 9 I learned the benefits and importance of monitoring tools which is being able to
									monitor and identify current resource consumption of the workload, being able to monitor these things the user or company could avoid wasting resources,
									increase the device's performance and see the consumption status easier. Lastly, In Hands-on Activity 10 I learned to install and configure Elastic Stack 
									(Elastic Search, Kibana, and Logtash) using a playbook while implementing roles to consolidate playbooks. I also learned new codes and ways that can be
									used in creating ansible playbooks and understand more about  creating and designing playbooks that can be used in installation and configuration of log monitoring
									tools. In addition, I learned the benefits of using log monitoring tools which is to improve a user, administrator or a company's security and root cause analysis
									capabilities.
								</p>

								
								<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hands-on activities performed in final period, I learned about docker and its benefits to the users. I also learned to create docker 
									images, dockerfile and to form a workflow in installing and building Dockerfile in remote servers using Ansible. In addition, this activity is essential to help me improve in forming workflows
									according to the given tasks. I've encountered some errors but I managed to solve it and through these process I learned and realized new things about
									docker and ansible. In Hands-on Activity 12 I learned to build a sample web app in a docker container, create a simple bash script, create a sample web app, configure the web app to use website files,
									creates bash script to build and run a docker container and to build, run and verify the docker container. In Hands-on Activity 13 I learned the process of installing, configuring and setting up the 
									OpenStack, and practice my skill in creating a flow using ansible. In addition I learned the benefits of implementing OpenStack to a user, administrator or a company, which is to improve the scalability of resources, 
									implements automation of tasks which makes cloud management easier and its fast development because of its active community that helps develop and improve OpenStack. In Hands-on Activity 14 I learned the process of installing and configuring
									OpenStack with Keystone, Glance and Nova services. In addition, I learned the purpose of Keystone, Glance and Nova service for Openstack. In which, the keystone is the Identity Service for OpenStack, Glance is the Imaging Service for
									 OpenStack and Nova is the Compute Service for OpenStack, these three services are important for the OpenStack cloud because these services will give the users secure access and the ability to utilize the cloud's computing resources. Lastly, 
									 In Hands-on Activity 15 I learned the process of installing and configuring the OpenStack with Neutron, Horizon and Cinder services. In doing this activity, I also learned the role of Neutron, Horizon and Cinder services for OpenStack. Neutron is the 
									 Networking Service for OpenStack, Horizon is the web-based dashboard for OpenStack and Cinder is the Block Storage Service for OpenStack, these services are important for the OpenStack cloud because these services will give the users the required tools
									 to manage and utilize the cloud's computing resources.
